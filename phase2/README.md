## Executive Summary:

For this second phase, we designed a wireframe and prototype to best match the data we collected in phase one. 

<img src="images/Sign In.png" width="200">
To begin, we created a simple login/signin page that uses the student account that all of CSU student already use. This eliminates any extra steps taken in having to create a new account and remember any new username/passwords. Forgot username and forgot passwords will be the same steps students have experience with.

After Sign in we start basic summary information for the user.Starting with a large counter of total available parking spots so students have an idea of the live traffic, show a map for user to click, a bar chart similar to google traffic to demonstrate the activityt of traffic, and a list of all spots at the CSU campus for users who like lists. Along with the list, users have the ability to pin their favorite spots to the top (similar to pinning posts on twitter).

After making their selection, the student confirms directions and is redirected to their google maps or imaps. Upon the destination becoming full and no longer available, the user received a pop up alert with automatic reroute to closest destination. The user has to option to cancel.  

<img src="images/Sort By.png" width="200"> <img src="images/Filter.png" width="200">

Student can sort their destination parking lots by availability and popularity. They can also filter parking by 3 categories: General, handicap and motorcycle. 

<img src="images/User Menu.png" width="200"> <img src="images/User Account.png" width="200"> <img src="images/User Settings.png" width="200"> <img src="images/User Feedback.png" width="200">

The user has basic settings to access and edit account information, logout, enable/disable notifications and GPS, and submit feedback.
