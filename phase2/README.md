## Executive Summary:

  - Investigated user experience to accommodate those with particular circumstances 
  
    - Such as a filter for handicap, motorcycles, and general
    
      - Gave users the option to pin their favorite locations
      
    - Added a crowd meter to have a general understanding of how times might impact the user 
    
  - Linked to the personas and scenarios to represent our users
  
    - It gave the user several options to choose between different locations and had a high error tolerance for miss clicking a location or being packed on the drive there.
    
    - Put in a chime that will automatically change the route once the parking lot is full, and this is for the user's safety
    
      - The alert can be canceled with a single click, similar to Google Maps
      
  - Made all wireframes interaction friendly 
  
    - All boxes or labels will lead to another wireframe
    
    - It is made to be as identical to an app as possible 
    
      - The app has a simple menu was included for the user to change their account information or modify the setting
      
        - Allowed the user to give back feedback  about their experience
        
## Wireframe Artboards

For this second phase, we designed a wireframe and prototype to best match the data we collected in phase one. 

<img src="images/Sign In.png" width="200">
To begin, we created a simple login/signin page that uses the student account that all of CSU student already use. This eliminates any extra steps taken in having to create a new account and remember any new username/passwords. Forgot username and forgot passwords will be the same steps students have experience with. 

<img src="images/Home Page.png" width="200">

After Sign in we start basic summary information for the user.Starting with a large counter of total available parking spots so students have an idea of the live traffic, show a map for user to click, a bar chart similar to google traffic to demonstrate the activityt of traffic, and a list of all spots at the CSU campus for users who like lists. Along with the list, users have the ability to pin their favorite spots to the top (similar to pinning posts on twitter).  

<img src="images/Confirm Directions.png" width="200"> <img src="images/Google Maps-imaps.png" width="200"> <img src="images/alert.PNG" width="200">

After making their selection, the student confirms directions and is redirected to their google maps or imaps. Upon the destination becoming full and no longer available, the user received a pop up alert with automatic reroute to closest destination. The user has to option to cancel.  

<img src="images/Sort By.png" width="200"> <img src="images/Filter.png" width="200">

Student can sort their destination parking lots by availability and popularity. They can also filter parking by 3 categories: General, handicap and motorcycle. 

<img src="images/User Menu.png" width="200"> <img src="images/User Account.png" width="200"> <img src="images/User Settings.png" width="200"> <img src="images/User Feedback.png" width="200">

The user has basic settings to access and edit account information, logout, enable/disable notifications and GPS, and submit feedback.
