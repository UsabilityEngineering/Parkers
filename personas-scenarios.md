# Scenarios
- **Tommy** is hurrying to get to his first scheduled class at 8:30AM at Chico State. Tommy checks his smart phone and the time is 8:15 when he enters parking lot C. Because many other students have class around that time, the parking lot is mostly full and Tommy finds it impossible to find an open parking spot, even though Tommy has a parking pass. Tommy spends 10 minutes looking for parking in parking lot C before he moves to parking lot B1. He spends another 5 minutes before successfully parking. The time is now 8:30 AM and Tommy is now able to walk from the parking lot to his class. Tommy is late for class.

- **Susie** commutes daily to school. She lives about an hour away from school so finding a parking spot is urgent and the only solution she has for school. She arrives at parking lot B at 9:45 AM and is trying to find a parking spot. Her first class begins at 10 AM. The parking lot is completely full. She does not have the option to head back home so finding a parking space is a must.  She leaves the parking lot to enter parking lot D2 at 9:55 (about 5 minutes distance between parking lot B and D2) It takes her another 5 minutes to successfully park. She parks at 10 AM and can now make her way to her class on foot. Susy is late.
