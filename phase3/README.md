## Phase 3: Usability Evaluation

# Executive Summary

  * The overall approach to the study is a formative study. 
  
  * Users will be asked to perform simple tasks and utilize our application prototype.
   
    - The participant will think aloud and explain their thoughts as they navigate through the app.
 
    - The participant will manipulate the features which will allow us to discover any underlying problems in the app. 
    
  * The participant will undergo a pilot test in which we will record and study.
   
  * Tasks are monitored and documented for efficiency and error tolerance. 
   
  * Overall satisfaction of the user experienced will be surveyed after the completion of tasks.


# Protocol Explanation

* Since this is a simple and straightforward app, there are three tasks that target different functions from the app. We will have the participants think out loud to get a full understanding of their thought processes as they navigate through each task.
