## Phase 3: Usability Evaluation

# Protocol Explanation

* Since this is a simple and straightforward app, there are three tasks that target different functions from the app. We will have the participants think out loud to get a full understanding of their thought processes as they navigate through each task. 
  
  **Task 1** 
  
  * The first set of questions are in a yes/no format. These questions allow us to understand whether or not the functions are effective and efficient for the user. We wanted to integrate SEEMULES to have a better understanding of what way there is a need to improve in our app.

    - Does the user successfully sign in to the application? y/n

   * We hope to discover whether there is a problem with the keyboard or the forgot username/password. We aim to make it safe as it links to the Chico Campus website.
   
     - Does the user use the map or the list to select a destination? Map/list
   
   * This will allow us to see how often the map is used or which function is used more than the other. We aim to make the process memorable whether the map or the list is used. 

      - Does the user select an open parking lot? y/n

    * We hope to understand the thought process of the user in their hopes to get their parking lot. Like did they aim at that parking lot for convenience or because there were open spots there?

      - Does the user set the destination?

    * We hope to discover if it is learnable as they flow through the app. Our idea is that it will be easy for the user to set a destination even for newcomers to a GPS function. 

      - Once the user is in route, note any of the following:
			# of reroutes, if any: 
			User ignores reroute: y/n
      
    * These questions explain how the user will interact with the directions in our app and how they will interact with our rerouting system. 

      - Did the user successfully park at their destination? y/n

    * This question will demonstrate if the process was effective or if there was a problem that was not discovered.

      - Is the user able to find the submit feedback form within the application? y/n

    * This will allow us to see if the function works and what is the userâ€™s thoughts on the feedback form option.
