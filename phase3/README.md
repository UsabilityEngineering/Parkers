## Phase 3: Usability Evaluation

# Executive Summary

# Protocol Explanation

* Since this is a simple and straightforward app, there are three tasks that target different functions from the app. We will have the participants think out loud to get a full understanding of their thought processes as they navigate through each task. 
  
  **Task 1** 
  
  * The first set of questions are in a yes/no format. These questions allow us to understand whether or not the functions are effective and efficient for the user. We wanted to integrate SEEMULES to have a better understanding of what way there is a need to improve in our app.

    - Does the user successfully sign in to the application? y/n

   * We hope to discover whether there is a problem with the keyboard or the forgot username/password. We aim to make it safe as it links to the Chico Campus website.
   
     - Does the user use the map or the list to select a destination? Map/list
   
   * This will allow us to see how often the map is used or which function is used more than the other. We aim to make the process memorable whether the map or the list is used. 

      - Does the user select an open parking lot? y/n

    * We hope to understand the thought process of the user in their hopes to get their parking lot. Like did they aim at that parking lot for convenience or because there were open spots there?

      - Does the user set the destination?

    * We hope to discover if it is learnable as they flow through the app. Our idea is that it will be easy for the user to set a destination even for newcomers to a GPS function. 

      - Once the user is in route, note any of the following:
			# of reroutes, if any: 
			User ignores reroute: y/n
      
    * These questions explain how the user will interact with the directions in our app and how they will interact with our rerouting system. 

      - Did the user successfully park at their destination? y/n

    * This question will demonstrate if the process was effective or if there was a problem that was not discovered.

      - Is the user able to find the submit feedback form within the application? y/n

    * This will allow us to see if the function works and what is the user’s thoughts on the feedback form option.

      - Ask the user how satisfied they are with the application and its usefulness on a scale of 1-5. 1 = not useful, 5 = very useful

    * This will allow the user to give feedback on which we can improve the app upon.

    **Task 2**

    * The second task targets the use of filters and the crowd meter in the app. It will be similar to the first task, just with the applications of filters in the list.

      - Does the user successfully use the filter option to their advantage? y/n

    * We hope to discover if the filters are effective and memorable for the user to use. Our goal is for it to be used often when setting a destination.

      - Did the user mark down their favorite location or did they disregard it?

    * This will allow us to see if it is understandable to use this option or can it be disregarded.

      - Did the user scroll through the options of different parking locations with motorcycle parking? y/n

    * This will reveal how useful the filter is and how it affects the list for the user’s purpose.

      - Identify how effectively the user can maneuver the list of locations.
      	- Did the user select or deselect from any filters? y/n

    * This will reveal how often the filters are used and the error tolerance that it has. Like if it is easy to remove the filter or apply it.

      - Ask the user how satisfied they are with the application and its usefulness on a scale of 1-5. 1 = not useful, 5 = very useful

    * This will allow the user to give feedback on which we can improve the app upon.

    **Task 3**
    
    * For task 3, it is simple as we process the use of setting favorites on certain parking locations. We ask the user to add and delete those favorites. 

      - Did the user locate the ‘pins’ in the list? y/n

      - Did the user successfully tap the pin to ‘save’ their favorite spots? y/n

      - Did the user successfully tap the pin again to ‘unsave’ a parking spot? y/n

    * This will show us if our conceptual model is used properly. We aimed it to be understandable and easy to manipulate. Therefore, this task will allow us to see how learnable the functions are.
   
   **Wrap up** 
   
   * This section of the protocol, we want to discover and learn about the user's thoughts and opion regarding the app. We aim to see how efficient it is and if there any was to further improve it upon. 
   
     - Now that you've used the app for some tasks, we’d like to know your thoughts and impressions of it. Overall, what did you enjoy most about the application?

     - What did you dislike about it? Was there anything you were confused about?

     - Are there any additional features that you would like for the application to have?
